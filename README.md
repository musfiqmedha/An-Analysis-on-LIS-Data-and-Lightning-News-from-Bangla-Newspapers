Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) is a sensor which is used to calculate various characteristics of lightning like event time, event place, amount, rate, radiance value, groups etc. These properties of lightning can be used to categorize lightning according to various aspects. In recent years the amount of lightning has increased at an alarming rate all over the country. Almost every day we find a lot of news of accidents due to lightning. There are a huge number of Bengali and English newspapers in our country. These newspapers contain a lot of news on lightning and its hazardous effects. We use this news to correlate with LIS data.
